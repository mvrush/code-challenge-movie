## Project Notes
My intention was to structure this project using a standard MVC methodology.
I spent a lot of time reading about Node.js and refreshing my memory on how it works.
I also researched Express and installed it with the intention of creating views with it.
I like to test small segments as I develop, hopefully that's reflected in my Git history.

I wish I could have gotten further in this project, but spent a lot of time reading documentation.
I could have done it much quicker using simple JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
